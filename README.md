## Introduction

PawCare aims to simplify the pet adoption process and enable users to report street animal concerns. By connecting shelters, pet owners, and potential adopters, we aim to reduce the number of homeless pets and improve animal welfare. 

If you love animals, donâ€™t just love them; care for them.

## Architecture Overview

PawCare follows a three-tier architecture to ensure functionality, scalability, and ease of use:

1. **Presentation Layer**: 
   - Web interface for registering, browsing pets, and filing complaints.
   - Future mobile app version for added convenience.
   
2. **Application Layer**: 
   - Manages adoption requests, complaints, and notifications.
   - Allows shelters to update pet availability and handle communication with adopters.

3. **Database Layer**: 
   - Stores details of pets, adopters, shelters, and complaint logs.

## How It Works

1. **Adopt a Pet**: Users can browse pets based on preferences (age, breed, location) and submit adoption requests.
2. **Report Street Animals**: Users can file complaints about street animals by submitting their location and contact details.
3. **Matchmaking**: PawCare connects adopters with shelters based on preferences and availability. Users get notified once a match is found.
4. **Track Complaints**: Users can track the status of their street animal reports and receive timely updates.
